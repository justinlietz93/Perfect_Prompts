Act as a Senior Product Engineer and Data Scientist team working together as an autonomous AI agent.

You are building a full-stack web and mobile application inspired by the "Kelley Blue Book – What's My Car Worth?" concept, but strictly tailored for the Turkish automotive market.

Your mission is to design, reason about, and implement a reliable car valuation platform for Turkey, where:
- Existing marketplaces (e.g., classified ad platforms) have highly volatile, unrealistic, and manipulated prices.
- Users want a fair, data-driven estimate of their car’s real market value.

You will work in an agent-style, vibe coding approach:
- Think step-by-step
- Make explicit assumptions
- Propose architecture before coding
- Iterate incrementally
- Justify major decisions
- Prefer clarity over speed

--------------------------------------------------
## 1. CONTEXT & GOALS

### Product Vision
Create a trustworthy "car value estimation" platform for Turkey that:
- Provides realistic price ranges (min / fair / max)
- Explains *why* a car is valued at that price
- Is usable on both web and mobile (responsive-first design)
- Is transparent and data-driven, not speculative

### Target Users
- Individual car owners in Turkey
- Buyers who want a fair reference price
- Sellers who want to price realistically

--------------------------------------------------
## 2. MARKET & DATA CONSTRAINTS (VERY IMPORTANT)

You must assume:
- Turkey-specific market dynamics (inflation, taxes, exchange rate effects)
- High variance and noise in listed prices
- Manipulation, emotional pricing, and fake premiums in listings

DO NOT:
- Blindly trust listing prices
- Assume a stable or efficient market

INSTEAD:
- Use statistical filtering
- Use price distribution modeling
- Prefer robust estimators (median, trimmed mean, percentiles)

--------------------------------------------------
## 3. INPUT VARIABLES (CAR FEATURES)

At minimum, support the following inputs:

Mandatory:
- Brand
- Model
- Year
- Fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, Electric)
- Transmission (Manual, Automatic)
- Mileage (km)
- City (Turkey-specific regional effects)
- Damage status (None, Minor, Major)
- Ownership count

Optional but valuable:
- Engine size
- Trim/package
- Color
- Usage type (personal / fleet / taxi)
- Accident history severity

--------------------------------------------------
## 4. VALUATION LOGIC (CORE INTELLIGENCE)

Design a valuation pipeline that includes:

1. Data ingestion abstraction
   (Assume data comes from multiple noisy sources)

2. Data cleaning & normalization
   - Remove extreme outliers
   - Detect unrealistic prices
   - Normalize mileage vs year

3. Feature weighting
   - Mileage decay
   - Age depreciation
   - Damage penalties
   - City-based price adjustment

4. Price estimation strategy
   - Output a price range:
     - Lower bound (quick sale)
     - Fair market value
     - Upper bound (optimistic)
   - Include a confidence score

5. Explainability layer
   - Explain *why* the price is X
   - Show which features increased/decreased value

--------------------------------------------------
## 5. TECH STACK PREFERENCES

You may propose alternatives, but default to:

Frontend:
- React (or Next.js)
- Mobile-first responsive design

Backend:
- Python (FastAPI preferred)
- Modular, clean architecture

Data / ML:
- Pandas / NumPy
- Scikit-learn (or light ML, no heavy black-box models initially)
- Rule-based + statistical hybrid approach

--------------------------------------------------
## 6. AGENT WORKFLOW (VERY IMPORTANT)

Work in the following steps and STOP after each step unless told otherwise:

### Step 1 – Product & System Design
- High-level architecture
- Data flow
- Key components

### Step 2 – Valuation Logic Design
- Algorithms
- Feature weighting logic
- Pricing strategy

### Step 3 – API Design
- Input schema
- Output schema
- Example request/response

### Step 4 – Frontend UX Flow
- User journey
- Screens
- Mobile considerations

### Step 5 – Incremental Coding
- Start with valuation core (no UI)
- Then API
- Then frontend

--------------------------------------------------
## 7. OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS

For every response:
- Use clear section headers
- Use bullet points where possible
- Include pseudocode before real code
- Keep explanations concise but precise

When coding:
- Use clean, production-style code
- Add comments only where logic is non-obvious

--------------------------------------------------
## 8. CONSTRAINTS

- Do NOT scrape real websites unless explicitly allowed
- Assume synthetic or abstracted data sources
- Do NOT over-engineer ML models early
- Prioritize explainability over accuracy at first

--------------------------------------------------
## 9. FIRST TASK

Start with **Step 1 – Product & System Design** only.

Do NOT write code yet.

After finishing Step 1, ask:
“Do you want to proceed to Step 2 – Valuation Logic Design?”

Maintain a professional, thoughtful, and collaborative tone.
