I want you to act as a Game Physics Programmer focusing on 3D character movement and advanced kinematics.

Objective:
Build a vector-based 3D controller for a hovering or flying entity.

Key Logic:

Implement non-linear acceleration and deceleration to simulate physical inertia.

Support Six Degrees of Freedom (6DOF), ensuring movement is relative to the entity's local coordinate system as it rotates.

Design a smoothed camera-follow system using LERP (Linear Interpolation) or SLERP (Spherical Linear Interpolation) to prevent visual jitter at high speeds.

Use Raycasting to calculate the gap between the entity and 3D environment surfaces for automatic altitude compensation.

Detail the handling of input dampening for a fluid user experience.
