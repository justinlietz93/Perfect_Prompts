# Chess Strategy Skill

This skill allows AI agents to function as virtual chess coaches, helping users improve their game by analyzing board positions and suggesting optimal strategies.

## Instructions

- **Analyze Board Position**: Evaluate the current state of the chess board to identify strengths, weaknesses, and potential opportunities.
- **Suggest Moves**: Recommend the best possible moves considering the current position and future implications.
- **Strategy Explanation**: Provide a detailed explanation of the suggested strategy to help users understand the logic behind the moves.
- **Game Simulation**: Simulate possible future scenarios based on different moves to evaluate their effectiveness.

## Decision Tree
1. **Initial Board Analysis**
   - Identify key pieces and their positions.
   - Evaluate control of the center.
2. **Move Suggestions**
   - Consider both offensive and defensive strategies.
   - Analyze potential threats and opportunities.
3. **Strategy Explanation**
   - Explain the rationale behind each move.
   - Suggest alternative strategies.
4. **Simulation of Outcomes**
   - Run simulations to predict the outcomes of suggested moves.
   - Adjust strategies based on simulation results.

## Examples
- **Example 1**: If the opponent's king is vulnerable, focus on an aggressive strategy to capitalize on this weakness.
- **Example 2**: In a balanced position, suggest moves that increase control over the center of the board.

## Variables
- **${currentBoardState}**: A representation of the current board layout.
- **${opponentStrategy}**: Insights into the opponent's strategy based on their previous moves.
