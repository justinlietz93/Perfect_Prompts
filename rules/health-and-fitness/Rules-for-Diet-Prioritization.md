## **I. Core Architecture & Hierarchy**
1.  **Follow the Priority Pyramid:** Execute diet variables in strictly descending order of importance:
    *   **1. Calorie Balance** (~50% impact)
    *   **2. Macronutrient Amounts** (~30% impact)
    *   **3. Nutrient Timing** (~10% impact)
    *   **4. Food Composition** (~5% impact)
    *   **5. Supplements and Hydration** (~5% impact)
2.  **Enforce the Caloric Constraint Hypothesis (CCH):** Calculate total caloric needs first. All macronutrient adjustments must occur within this fixed limit (e.g., increasing protein requires a mathematical decrease in fats or carbohydrates).
3.  **Segregate Phases:** Do not attempt simultaneous fat loss and muscle gain (recomposition) unless the subject is a beginner, returning from a layoff, or using pharmacological aids. Execute distinct, dedicated phases for Fat Loss, Muscle Gain, Post-Diet Maintenance, and Long Term Maintenance.

## **II. Macronutrient Constraints**
4.  **Protein Baselines:**
    *   **General Health:** Minimum 0.3g per pound of body weight.
    *   **Endurance Athletes:** 0.5–1.0g/lb (Optimal: 0.7g).
    *   **Team Sports:** 0.6–1.5g/lb (Optimal: 0.8g).
    *   **Strength/Power:** 0.7–2.0g/lb (Optimal: 0.9–1.0g).
    *   **Hypocaloric (Fat Loss):** Minimum 0.8g/lb (Optimal: 1.0–1.2g; Max: 1.5g).
    *   **Hypercaloric (Muscle Gain):** Minimum 0.7g/lb (Optimal: 1.0g; Max: 1.5g).
5.  **Fat Baselines & Limits:**
    *   **Minimum:** 0.3g per pound per day (hormonal floor).
    *   **Maximum:** Capped at the CCH limit or approx. 40% of total daily calories.
    *   **Saturated Fat:** Limit to <10% of total daily calories.
6.  **Carbohydrate Baselines:**
    *   **General Health:** Minimum 0.3g/lb (vegetables/fruits).
    *   **Endurance:** 1.5g to ~5.0g/lb depending on volume.
    *   **Strength/Power:** 1.0–2.5g/lb (Base avg: 1.5g).
    *   **Phase Constraints:** In fat loss, maintain min 1.0g/lb (unless extreme prep). In muscle gain, maximize remaining calories here after protein/fat requirements.

## **III. Nutrient Timing & Frequency**
7.  **Meal Syntax:** Consume 4–8 meals per day spaced 3–6 hours apart.
8.  **Protein Spreading:** Distribute protein evenly across all meals (1/4 to 1/8 of total). Ensure every meal contains ~20–25g protein to hit leucine thresholds.
9.  **Peri-Workout Timing:**
    *   **Pre-Training:** Eat 30 mins to 4 hours prior. Minimize fat/fiber as proximity to training increases.
    *   **Intra-Training:** Only for sessions >60 mins. Use 5–10% daily protein + fast-digesting carbs.
    *   **Post-Training:** Eat within 1 hour. Prioritize high-GI carbs, lean protein, minimal fat.
    *   **Bedtime:** Consume slow-digesting protein (casein) and/or fats/fiber.

## **IV. Periodization & Phase Management**
10. **Fat Loss Parameters:**
    *   **Rate:** 0.5% to 1.0% body weight loss per week.
    *   **Duration:** 3 to 16 weeks.
    *   **Limit:** Max 10% total body weight loss per phase.
    *   **Training:** Must perform high-volume hypertrophy training to prevent catabolism.
11. **Muscle Gain Parameters:**
    *   **Rate:** 0.25% to 0.5% body weight gain per week.
    *   **Duration:** 6 to 24 weeks.
    *   **Limit:** Max 10% total body weight gain (beginner) or 5% (advanced) per phase.
    *   **Resensitization:** Follow gain phases with a low-volume maintenance phase (min 4 weeks).
12. **Maintenance Parameters:**
    *   **Post-Diet:** Duration equal to 2/3 to 1x the length of the preceding diet.
    *   **Post-Gain:** Maintain for 1–2 months before cutting.

## **V. Diet Design & Adjustment Logic**
13. **Calorie Calculation:** 1 lb tissue ≈ 3500 calories. Use `(Target lbs/week * 3500) / 7` to determine daily deficit/surplus.
14. **Adjustment Trigger:** Change diet variables only after 2–3 weeks of consistent weight trend deviation.
15. **Hypocaloric Adjustment Hierarchy (Cutting):** Reduce Fats first (to 0.3g/lb min) $\rightarrow$ Reduce Carbs next (to 1.0g/lb min) $\rightarrow$ Reduce Protein last (if above optimal).
16. **Hypercaloric Adjustment Hierarchy (Massing):** Add Carbs first $\rightarrow$ Add Fats next.
17. **Training Day Classification:**
    *   **Light:** <60 min, <10 sets.
    *   **Moderate:** 60–120 min, 10–25 sets.
    *   **Hard:** >120 min, >25 sets.
    *   **Twice-Daily:** Multiply "Hard" carb recs by 1.15; consume high-GI carbs between sessions.

## **VI. Acute Weight Cutting & Competition Protocols**
18. **General Cut Limit:** Maximum permissible water cut loss is 5% of body weight (requires medical clearance).
19. **Pre-Weigh-In Timeline:**
    *   **4 Days Out:** Restrict carbs to $\le$0.3g/lb. Load water (~4L per 100lb body weight). Normal salt.
    *   **48 Hours Out:** Reduce salt by ~70%.
    *   **24 Hours Out:** Restrict water (sips only). Stop drinking completely ~12 hours pre-weigh-in. Limit fiber/volume.
20. **Hyperthermia Safety:**
    *   **Limit:** Max 1% body weight loss via sweating/sauna.
    *   **Duration:** Max 20-minute intervals.
    *   **Oversight:** Observer required. Stop immediately if vision blurs or coordination fails.
21. **Replenishment Strategy (Post-Weigh-In):**
    *   **Fluid Constraint:** Never drink >1L plain water in a single sitting. Use electrolyte beverages for larger volumes.
    *   **12-Hour Replenishment:** Target ~4.0L fluids/100lb, ~25 cal/lb, ~4.5g carbs/lb, ~0.7g protein/lb.
    *   **24-Hour Replenishment:** Target ~6.0L fluids/100lb, ~35 cal/lb, ~7g carbs/lb (limit 1g/lb every 2 hours), ~0.7g protein/lb.
22. **Competition Performance:**
    *   **Endurance Loading:** Increase carbs by 3–5g/lb starting 24hrs pre-event (>3hr duration).
    *   **Intra-Competition:** Cap carbs at 90g/hour.

## **VII. Hydration, Supplements, & Lifestyle**
23. **Hydration Baseline:** Drink to thirst or ~1.5ml per calorie eaten.
24. **Supplement Whitelist:** Permitted list includes Caffeine, Whey, Casein, Creatine Monohydrate (~3g/100lb), Carb powders, Multivitamins, and Omega-3s.
25. **Probiotics:** Must have USP label and 1M–1B CFU.
26. **Caffeine Cap:** Max 1000mg/day or 300mg/single dose.
27. **Alcohol Constraints:**
    *   **Standard Unit:** 12oz beer (5%), 5oz wine (12%), 1.5oz liquor (40%).
    *   **Limit:** Max 2–4 drinks per occasion. Cease consumption hours before bed.

## **VIII. Special Populations**
28. **Vegan Diets:** Increase protein intake by 20% to account for bioavailability. Mandatory supplementation of Zinc, Iron, B12, Calcium, Vit D, and Creatine.
29. **Pregnancy/Post-Partum:** No weight loss dieting during pregnancy. Post-partum loss limit: 1% body weight/week while breastfeeding.
30. **Children:** Protein 0.5–1.0g/lb. Fat <30% total calories.
31. **GI Distress:** Utilize low-FODMAP foods if severe IBS symptoms present.

## Key Highlights

* Adhere to the Priority Pyramid, which ranks Calorie Balance as the most critical factor (50%), followed by Macronutrients (30%) and Nutrient Timing (10%).
* Avoid attempting simultaneous fat loss and muscle gain; instead, execute distinct, dedicated phases for Fat Loss, Muscle Gain, and Maintenance.
* Target a daily protein intake of roughly 0.7g to 1.0g per pound of body weight to optimize muscle retention and growth.
* Consume 4–8 meals per day spaced 3–6 hours apart, ensuring protein is distributed evenly across all meals to maximize synthesis.
* Limit fat loss rates to 0.5%–1.0% of body weight per week to prevent muscle catabolism, with diet phases lasting no longer than 16 weeks.
* Restrict muscle gain rates to 0.25%–0.5% of body weight per week to ensure weight gained is primarily lean tissue rather than fat.
* After a fat loss phase, implement a maintenance phase lasting two-thirds to the full duration of the preceding diet to stabilize weight and metabolism.
* When hitting a weight loss plateau, reduce fats first (to a minimum of 0.3g/lb), then carbohydrates, while keeping protein intake high.
* Optimize performance by consuming carbohydrates and protein 30 minutes to 4 hours pre-workout and immediately post-workout, while minimizing fats and fiber near training.
