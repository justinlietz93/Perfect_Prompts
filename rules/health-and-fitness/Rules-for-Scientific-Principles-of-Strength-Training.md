## **I. Architecture & Macro-Cycle Design**
*   **Adhere to Sequential Potentiation:** Strictly structure macrocycles in the following order: **Hypertrophy/Work Capacity $\rightarrow$ Basic Strength $\rightarrow$ Peaking $\rightarrow$ Active Rest**.
*   **Enforce Directed Adaptation:** Do not train conflicting goals simultaneously. Ensure at least **70% of training volume** within a block is specific to that phase's goal, limiting non-phasic work to a maximum of 30%.
*   **Modality Compatibility:** Avoid high-volume endurance training that converts fast-twitch fibers to slow-twitch. Limit cardiovascular work to low-impact modalities (swimming, biking) and a maximum expenditure of **1,500 calories per week**.
*   **Phase Duration Constraints:**
    *   Maintain a specific phase for a minimum of **3 weeks** to allow for adaptation.
    *   Do not exceed **6 months** for Hypertrophy or Strength phases.
    *   Do not exceed **3 months** for Peaking phases to prevent atrophy.

## **II. Phase-Specific Syntax & Parameters**
Configure training blocks using the following quantitative constraints:

**1. Hypertrophy / Work Capacity Phase**
*   **Intensity:** 60% to 75% 1RM (Hard Cap: 80% 1RM).
*   **Volume:** 15–30 overloading sets per muscle group per week.
*   **Frequency:** 2–6 overloading sessions per muscle group per week.
*   **Reps:** 6–10 reps per set.
*   **Progression:** Prioritize volume increases (sets) over intensity. Add 0–1 sets or 5–20 lbs (2.5–5%) per week.

**2. Basic Strength Phase**
*   **Intensity:** 75% to 90% 1RM.
*   **Volume:** 10–20 overloading sets per muscle group per week.
*   **Frequency:** 2–4 overloading sessions per muscle group per week.
*   **Reps:** 3–6 reps per set.
*   **Progression:** Prioritize intensity increases while maintaining moderate volume.

**3. Peaking Phase**
*   **Intensity:** Polarized approach. Execute Overload Sessions at **85%–95% 1RM** and Light Sessions at **~50% 1RM**.
*   **Volume:** 5–10 overloading sets per muscle group per week.
*   **Frequency:** 1–3 overloading sessions per muscle group per week.
*   **Reps:** 1–3 reps per set.

**4. Active Rest Phase**
*   **Duration:** 1–3 weeks (post-competition or post-macrocycle).
*   **Constraints:** Cap intensity at 50% 1RM; cap volume at 5–10 sets per body part. **No progression** permitted.

## **III. Overload, Fatigue & Recovery Management**
*   **Maximum Recoverable Volume (MRV):** Volume must approach but not consistently exceed MRV. If performance falls below baseline reps/weight at a specific intensity, mark that point as the MRV limit.
*   **SRA Timing:** Schedule training sessions to align with the adaptive peak of the previous session’s Stimulus-Recovery-Adaptation curve. Avoid clustering excessive overloading sessions without adequate recovery spacing.
*   **Rest Day Mandate:** Schedule at least one, preferably two, full rest days per week.
*   **Deload Protocol:**
    *   Implement a deload week at the end of every mesocycle (every 3–5 weeks).
    *   **Logic:** First half of week at 50% volume / 90% intensity; second half of week at 50% volume / 50% intensity.
*   **Light Session Mathematics:**
    *   **Hypertrophy Phase:** Volume ~50% / Intensity ~90% of overload days.
    *   **Strength Phase:** Volume ~70% / Intensity ~70% of overload days.
    *   **Peaking Phase:** Volume ~90% / Intensity ~50% of overload days.

## **IV. Tapering & Competition Protocols**
*   **Taper Structure:** Implement a taper sequence of **Functional Overreaching $\rightarrow$ Reduced Volume/Maintained Intensity $\rightarrow$ Reduced Volume/Reduced Intensity**.
*   **Competition Specificity:** In the final month pre-meet, use strict competition technique (no straps, specific pauses) and equipment.
*   **Taper Duration Algorithm:** Calculate the **Taper Category Score** to determine duration (1–3 weeks):
    1.  **Score Points:**
        *   **Weight:** <165lbs (1), 165–220lbs (2), >220lbs (3).
        *   **Class/Strength:** Class 2 (1), Class 1/Master (2), Elite/Pro (3).
        *   **Experience:** <3yrs (1), 3–6yrs (2), >6yrs (3).
    2.  **Determine Category:**
        *   **Score 3–4:** 1-Week Taper.
        *   **Score 5–7:** 2-Week Taper.
        *   **Score 8–9:** 3-Week Taper.

## **V. Exercise Selection & Technique Standards**
*   **Specificity Bound:** Select exercises that mechanically resemble competition lifts. Prioritize compound variations over isolation work, especially in Strength phases.
*   **Variation Phasing:** Utilize high variation (lower specificity) furthest from the competition; increase specificity as the competition approaches. Do not rotate exercises every session.
*   **Mechanical Constraints:**
    *   **Squat/Deadlift:** Maintain lordotic lumbar spine.
    *   **Squat:** No knee cave (valgus).
    *   **Bench Press:** Retract shoulder blades.
    *   **Deadlift:** No bent elbows.
*   **Equipment Safety:**
    *   Do not use unstable surfaces (e.g., Bosu balls) for primary force production.
    *   Limit accommodating resistance (bands/chains) to a maximum of **10% above 1RM** for raw lifters.
*   **Mobility:** Do not perform excessive flexibility/mobility work immediately prior to heavy training.

## Key Highlights

* Strictly structure macrocycles in the sequential order of Hypertrophy/Work Capacity, Basic Strength, Peaking, and Active Rest to ensure sequential potentiation.
* Ensure at least 70% of training volume within a block is specific to that phase's goal to prevent conflicting adaptations.
* Limit cardiovascular work to low-impact modalities and a maximum expenditure of 1,500 calories per week to avoid converting fast-twitch fibers.
* Hypertrophy phases should prioritize volume with 60–75% 1RM for 6–10 reps, while Basic Strength phases prioritize intensity with 75–90% 1RM for 3–6 reps.
* Peaking phases require a polarized approach, utilizing overload sessions at 85–95% 1RM and light sessions at approximately 50% 1RM.
* Training volume must approach but not consistently exceed Maximum Recoverable Volume (MRV), defined as the point where performance drops below baseline.
* Implement a deload week at the end of every mesocycle (every 3–5 weeks) to facilitate recovery and adaptation.
* Determine the duration of the pre-competition taper (1–3 weeks) based on a weighted score of the lifter's body weight, strength classification, and experience.
* Exercise selection should transition from high variation with lower specificity to strict competition technique as the meet approaches.

## Example Ideas

* Develop a dynamic 'Taper Category Calculator' to automate the assignment of 1, 2, or 3-week taper durations based on the specific weight, strength class, and experience scoring algorithm provided.
* Design a monitoring dashboard to track athlete volume relative to performance benchmarks, specifically flagging when performance falls below baseline to identify individual Maximum Recoverable Volume (MRV) limits.
* Construct a standard macrocycle template that enforces the 'Hypertrophy > Strength > Peaking' sequence, ensuring phase durations strictly adhere to the 3-week minimum and specific maximum time caps.
* Audit current athlete conditioning protocols to ensure cardiovascular expenditure does not exceed the 1,500 calorie/week limit and is restricted to low-impact modalities like swimming or biking.
