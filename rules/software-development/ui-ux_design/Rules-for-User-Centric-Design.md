# Rules for User Centric Design

**Generated on:** November 7, 2025 at 5:58 PM CST

---

## **General Principles**

* **Responsibility:** You must find the truth; it is not anyone else's responsibility to show it to you.
* **Goal:** Your goal is to find the truth of how to make your business succeed, not to be right.
* **Truth Seeking:** You must learn to love bad news as it represents solid learning and brings you closer to the truth.
* **Approval Seeking:** Do not seek approval for your ideas. People's approval does not make your business better.
* **Value of Opinions:** Recognize that opinions are worthless, unless from a deep industry expert.
* **Future Predictions:** Do not rely on anything involving the future, as it is an over-optimistic lie.
* **Honesty:** Understand that people will lie to you if they think it's what you want to hear.
* **Problem Ownership:** You are not allowed to tell customers what their problem is. Customers own the problem.
* **Solution Ownership:** Customers are not allowed to tell you what to build. You own the solution.
* **Core Purpose:** Customer conversations are a tool to learn, not an obligation. If a conversation won't help or you don't want to do it, skip it.
* **Process Avoidance:** Having a process is valuable, but do not get stuck in it.

## **Conversation Execution**

* **The Mom Test Rules:**
  * Talk about the customer's life instead of your idea.
  * Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future.
  * Talk less and listen more.
* **Idea Introduction:** Do not mention your idea too soon. Keep your idea out of the conversation until you're ready to ask for commitments.
* **Ego Management:** Keep your ego out of the conversation. If you've mentioned your idea, people will try to protect your feelings.
* **Pitching:** Do not slip into "pitch mode" during learning conversations. If you slip, apologize, cut yourself off, and redirect to the customer's concerns.
* **Talking Time:** Talk less than the customer. The more you are talking, the worse you are doing.
* **Formalities:** Avoid being overly formal in early customer conversations.
* **Casual Approach:** Conduct learning about customers and their problems as quick, casual chats rather than long, formal meetings.
* **Information Disclosure:** Give as little information as possible about your idea while still nudging the discussion in a useful direction.
* **Emotional Signals:** When you see deep emotion, do your utmost to keep that person close, as they are a rare, precious fan who will get you through hard times.

## **Question Crafting**

* **Avoid "Good Idea" Questions:** Do not ask "Do you think it's a good idea?"
* **Avoid Hypotheticals:** Do not ask "Would you buy a product which did X?" or "How much would you pay for X?"
* **Focus on Past Actions:** Ask about specifics in the past rather than generics or opinions about the future.
* **Dig for Motivation:** When customers suggest features or express strong emotions, dig into their motivations by asking "Why?" or "What would that let you do?"
* **Understand Goals:** Ask questions that reveal customers' goals, as you are shooting blind until you understand them.
* **Identify Costly Problems:** Ask about the implications of problems to distinguish between "I-will-pay-to-solve-that" problems and minor annoyances.
* **Observe Behavior:** Ask customers to "Talk me through the last time that happened" or "Talk me through your workflow" to learn through their actions.
* **Explore Alternatives:** Ask "What else have you tried?" and "How are you dealing with it now?" to understand current solutions, costs, and commitment.
* **B2B Money Questions:** In a B2B context, you must ask "Where does the money come from?" to understand budget owners and power dynamics.
* **Referral Request:** End every conversation by asking "Who else should I talk to?"
* **Important Questions:** You must apply The Mom Test to questions that matter. Every time you talk to someone, you should be asking a question that has the potential to completely destroy your currently imagined business.
* **Permission to Ask About Money:** You are allowed to ask about money.
* **Avoid Premature Zoom:** Do not zoom in on unimportant details or problem areas before having solid evidence that you are fixing a meaningful problem for your customer segment. Start broad and do not zoom in until you've found a strong signal.

## **Data Interpretation**

* **Compliment Deflection:** If customers give compliments, deflect them and get back to gathering facts and commitments. Compliments are worthless.
* **Fluff Anchoring:** When customers offer generic claims, future-tense promises, or hypothetical "maybes" (fluff), anchor them to specifics in the past. Do not value fluffy answers.
* **Idea Interpretation:** Understand ideas and feature requests, but do not obey them. Dig beneath them to find the root cause and motivations.
* **Negative Signals:** Love bad news and lukewarm responses ("meh") more than enthusiastic "Wow!" responses, as they provide reliable information. Do not ignore bad news or lukewarm signals in search of validation.
* **Commitment as Truth:** The more a customer gives up (time, reputation, money), the more seriously you can take their kind words and feedback.
* **Zombie Leads:** Recognize that "customers" who are friendly but will never buy are a dangerous source of mixed signals. Do not allow a pipeline of zombie leads to form.

## **Meeting Management**

* **Meeting Outcomes:** Every meeting either succeeds or fails; there is no such thing as a meeting that "just went well."
* **Success Criteria:** A meeting has succeeded when it ends with a commitment to advance to the next step.
* **Force Resolution:** You must force a resolution to a meeting by pushing for commitment or clear next steps.
* **Next Steps:** If you don't know what happens next after a product or sales meeting, the meeting was pointless.
* **Clear Commitments:** Convert fuzzy promises (e.g., "I'd love to try it when it launches") into concrete, current commitments (e.g., pre-purchase, trial enrollment, introduction to decision-makers).
* **Trial Cost:** If your trial is too "cheap" to try, increase its cost by asking for commitments like case studies or team-wide usage.
* **Team Involvement:** If selling to companies, you must talk to multiple people within the organization. If they won't introduce you to others, it is a dead end.
* **Lead Identification:** A lead is not real until you have given them a concrete chance to reject you.
* **Sales Mindset:** In early stage sales, the real goal is learning; revenue is just a side-effect.
* **Meeting Framing (Syntax):** When asking for a meeting, use a framing format with 5 key elements:
    1. **Vision:** (Half-sentence version of how you’re making the world better).
    2. **Framing:** (Where you're at and what you're looking for, often stating you have nothing to sell).
    3. **Weakness:** (Show how you can be helped by mentioning your specific problem).
    4. **Pedestal:** (Show how they, in particular, can provide that help).
    5. **Ask:** (Ask for help).
* **Meeting Control:** Once a meeting starts, you must grab the reins. You set the agenda, keep it on topic, and propose next steps. Be assertive without being a jerk.
* **Meeting Medium:** Start customer conversations in person, as calls damage the delicate power dynamic and lead to less valuable information.
* **Mindset Switch:** Do not go into discussions looking for customers; instead, go in search of industry and customer advisors. Do not explicitly tell them you're looking for advisors unless it naturally arises.

## **Team & Process**

* **Learning Bottleneck:** Avoid being a "learning bottleneck." The business person must not be the sole interpreter of customer learning for the team.
* **Team Participation:** Everyone on the team who is making big decisions (including technical decisions) needs to go to at least some customer meetings.
* **Meeting Size:** Ideally, have two people in a meeting (one talks, one takes notes). Do not send more than two people unless there's a strong reason.
* **Outsourcing Learning:** You cannot outsource or hire someone to do customer learning. Founders must be in the meetings themselves until a working business model and repeatable sales/marketing process exist.
* **Customer Segmentation:**
  * Good customer segmentation is crucial for progress.
  * Do not start too generically, as it waters down efforts.
  * Before serving everyone, you must serve someone.
  * If you are not finding consistent problems and goals, your customer segment is not specific enough.
  * Ensure your customer segment is a "who-where pair" – if you don't know where to find your customers, keep slicing the segment until you do.
  * Choose a customer segment that is specific, reachable, profitable, and personally rewarding.
* **Pre-Conversation Process:**
  * Choose a focused, findable segment.
  * With your team, decide your "big 3" learning goals.
  * If relevant, decide on ideal next steps and commitments.
  * If conversations are the right tool, figure out who to talk to.
  * Create a series of best guesses about what the person cares about.
  * If a question can be answered via desk research, do that first.
  * Do basic due diligence on LinkedIn and company websites before business meetings.
  * Sit down with your whole founding team when you prep.
  * Ask "If this company were to fail, why would it have happened?" to unearth hidden risks.
  * Ask "What would have to be true for this to be a huge success?" to identify critical pieces.
  * Do not have a conversation if you do not know what you are trying to learn.
  * Do not spend a week prepping; spend an hour, then talk to people.
  * Do not spend months on full-time conversations before moving on a product; spend a week or two.
* **Post-Conversation Process:**
  * Review your notes with your team and update your beliefs and "big 3" questions.
  * Disseminate learnings to your team as quickly and directly as possible using notes and exact quotes.
  * Decide on the next 3 big questions.
* **Iteration Speed:** You should be able to answer almost any customer question and move onto new ones within a week.

## **Note-Taking**

* **Importance:** Take good notes to keep your team, investors, and advisors in the loop, and to prevent lying to yourself.
* **Exact Quotes:** When possible, write down exact quotes.
* **Syntax for Quotes:** Wrap exact quotes in quotation marks (" ").
* **Symbols:** Add symbols to notes for context and shorthand (e.g., ❗ for pain/problem, 🥅 for goal, 🚧 for obstacle, ⚙️ for workaround, ⛰️ for background, 💡 for feature request, 💲 for money, 👤 for specific person/company, ⭐ for follow-up).
* **Note Properties:** Notes must be:
  * Able to be sorted, mixed, and re-arranged.
  * Able to be combined with other team members' notes.
  * Permanent and retrievable.
  * Not mixed in with other random noise like todo lists and ideas.
* **Location:** Avoid taking notes in your primary notebook for customer conversations; use dedicated methods like index cards, Post-it notes, or digital spreadsheets/Evernote for better organization.
* **Transferring Notes:** If notes are taken in non-ideal places (e.g., paper plates, beer mats), transfer them to your permanent format after the meeting.
* **No Notes Possible:** If it's totally inappropriate to take notes, have the conversation, then immediately retreat to write down what was said.
* **Review Requirement:** Notes are useless if you do not look at them (review them yourself and with your team).

## **Terminology**

* **Customer Conversation:** Use "customer conversation" (lowercase) to refer to chatting with people.
* **Customer Development:** Use "Customer Development" (uppercase) to refer to the broader process as defined by Steve Blank.

## Key Highlights

* You must find the truth, not just be right, and learn to love bad news as it provides solid learning. Recognize that opinions are worthless unless from a deep industry expert, and never seek approval for your ideas.
* Customers own their problems, but you own the solution; therefore, do not tell customers their problem or allow them to tell you what to build.
* During conversations, talk about the customer's life and specific past actions, not your idea or future opinions. Talk less and listen more to gather unbiased information and keep your ego out of the discussion.
* Avoid asking 'good idea' or hypothetical questions; instead, focus on past behaviors, dig into motivations with 'Why?', and identify problems customers will truly pay to solve.
* Love bad news and lukewarm responses more than enthusiastic praise, as they offer reliable information. The more a customer commits time, reputation, or money, the more seriously you can take their feedback.
* Every meeting must succeed by concluding with a concrete commitment to advance to the next step, or it is pointless. Force a clear resolution and ensure you know what happens next.
* Founders must personally conduct customer learning until a working business model and repeatable sales/marketing process are established; this critical early-stage function cannot be outsourced.
* Crucial for progress is good customer segmentation; ensure your segment is a specific, findable 'who-where pair' to avoid generic efforts and inconsistent problem identification.

## Example ideas

* Conduct a comprehensive audit of existing customer interaction workflows, meeting structures, and communication habits against the detailed principles and rules outlined in 'The Mom Test' to identify areas of non-compliance and immediate improvement opportunities.
* Develop and implement a standardized customer conversation note-taking system, incorporating the specified symbols, ensuring permanent storage, and establishing a regular team review process for analysis and dissemination of learnings.
* Design and conduct internal training sessions for all product, sales, and strategic decision-makers on effective customer conversation techniques, emphasizing 'The Mom Test' rules, honest data interpretation (e.g., loving bad news), and commitment-focused interactions.
* Review and refine the current customer segmentation strategy, ensuring each segment is a 'who-where pair' that is specific, reachable, profitable, and enables focused learning about consistent problems and goals.
* Establish clear, measurable success criteria and mandatory commitment expectations for all customer and sales meetings, with a focus on converting fuzzy promises into concrete next steps (e.g., trials, introductions, pre-purchases).
