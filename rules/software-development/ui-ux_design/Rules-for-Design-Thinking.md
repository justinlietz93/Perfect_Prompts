## **Design Thinking Process & Principles**

* Design thinking must integrate what is desirable from a human point of view with what is technologically feasible and economically viable.
* Design thinking projects must not be open-ended; they must have a beginning, middle, and an end.
* Design projects must articulate a clear goal at the outset.
* A design project must operate within natural deadlines to impose discipline and allow for progress review and corrections.
* Design thinking needs to be practiced by both the design team and the client.
* The design thinking process must rhythmically exchange between divergent and convergent phases.
* Analysis and synthesis are equally important in design thinking.
* Project briefs must not be a set of instructions or an attempt to answer a question before it has been posed.
* A well-constructed project brief must allow for serendipity, unpredictability, and the capricious whims of fate.
* Design thinking requires bridging the "knowing-doing gap."
* Design thinking must privilege the intended user as a starting point (human-centered approach).
* The first step in innovation efforts must ensure close proximity to intended customers.
* Do not approach new ideas by starting with prevailing business constraints (e.g., marketing budgets, supply-chain networks), as this leads to incremental, easily copied ideas.
* Do not settle for the first good idea or promising solution; demand options.
* If you haven’t explored lots of options, you haven’t diverged enough.

## **Project Management & Teams**

* Project teams must navigate between three overlapping spaces: inspiration, ideation, and implementation.
* Individual team members in an interdisciplinary environment must possess depth of skill (vertical axis of a "T-shaped" person).
* Team members must be active in each of the spaces of innovation (inspiration, ideation, and implementation).
* For complex problems, do not increase the size of the core team early on; this reduces speed and efficiency.
* Channel team energy productively by using many small teams instead of one large team.
* The inspiration phase of a project requires a small, focused group to establish the overall framework.
* Creative teams need to be able to share their thoughts verbally, visually, and physically.
* The promise of electronic collaboration must not be to create dispersed but ever-bigger teams.
* The goal of electronic collaboration should be to create interdependent networks of small teams.
* Project rooms must allow accumulated research materials, photos, storyboards, concepts, and prototypes to be out and available at all times.
* There must be a plan for reintegration of participants returning from specialized creative environments (e.g., "skunk works") into the organization.
* Core team members must be able to follow a project through its complete cycle.

## **Innovation Culture**

* The organizational ecosystem must provide room for experimentation (not just designers, engineers, or management).
* Do not favor ideas based on who creates them.
* Ideas that create a buzz should be favored and gain a vocal following before organizational support.
* Senior leadership must use "gardening" skills to tend, prune, and harvest ideas.
* An overarching purpose must be articulated for the organization to provide direction and reduce constant supervision needs.
* Do not let the results of bottom-up experimentation dissipate into unstructured ideas and unresolved plans.
* A serious commitment from the top of the corporate pyramid is needed to support bottom-up ideas.
* Any promising experiment must have a chance to gain organizational support with appropriate resources and definable goals.
* Organizations must cultivate optimism to harvest the power of design thinking.
* People within the organization must believe it is within their power (or their team's) to create new ideas that serve unmet needs and have a positive impact.
* Corporations need a culture of competing ideas.
* Leaders must encourage experimentation and accept that failure is acceptable if it happens early and becomes a source of learning.
* The real test of a prototype is external, not internal.
* Design thinking is fast-paced, unruly, and disruptive; resist the temptation to slow it down with cumbersome budgeting or bureaucratic reporting.
* Be prepared to rethink funding schedules as projects unfold, rather than sabotaging creative assets.
* Agile budgeting requires a review process that relies on senior leadership judgment, not mechanical algorithmic processes.
* Companies should actively spot, nurture, and free design thinking talent.
* If staff are designers, get them out of their studio and into interdisciplinary teams.
* If staff are from Accounting, Legal, or HR, give them art supplies to engage in creative processes.
* Actively bring people together in the same room for collaborative, generative work to produce tangible outcomes, rather than just more meetings.
* Manage a diversified portfolio of innovation, including both incremental and revolutionary ideas.
* Creative leaders must support the search for breakthrough ideas from the top.

## **Prototyping**

* Prototyping must include studies that may appear rough and simple and encompass more than just physical objects.
* Prototypes should command only as much time, effort, and investment as is necessary to generate useful feedback and drive an idea forward.
* The goal of prototyping is not to create a working model, but to give form to an idea to learn about its strengths and weaknesses and to identify new directions.
* A prototype's scope must be limited.
* Designers need to take prototypes out into the world to get feedback from intended users.
* Later-stage prototypes may require more attention to surface qualities to prevent distraction from rough edges or unresolved details.
* Do not use sophisticated technology to create prototypes that are too refined, too detailed, or too early.
* "Just enough prototyping" means picking what to learn about and achieving just enough resolution to focus on that.
* Early prototypes should be fast, rough, and cheap.
* For early-stage prototyping, team members should make their own prototypes rather than outsourcing.
* Motivate early-stage prototyping by setting a goal to have a prototype ready by the end of the first week or day.
* Prototypes need to be testable, but they do not need to be physical.
* When precision for prototypes exceeds team capabilities, turn to outside experts (e.g., model makers, videographers, writers, actors).
* A successful prototype must teach something about objectives, process, and ourselves, not necessarily work flawlessly.

## **Insights & Research**

* Be human-centered; put people first.
* Do not rely on traditional focus groups and surveys (asking people what they want) for breakthrough insights, as they rarely yield important insights beyond incremental improvements.
* Seek out ultimate clients where they live, work, and play through intensive observation.
* Observation relies on quality, not quantity.
* For new and surprising insights, head for the edges of the market to find "extreme" users.
* Do not prejudge the problem or make assumptions about user desires.
* Social scientists working in industry must be integrated into cross-disciplinary project teams.
* Clients should be enlisted to conduct observations themselves.
* To "borrow" the lives of others for new ideas, begin by recognizing that their seemingly inexplicable behaviors represent strategies for coping with their world.
* Do not generalize from one's own standards and expectations, as this limits opportunity.
* Achieve a state of empathy by seeing the world through the eyes of others, understanding through their experiences, and feeling through their emotions.
* For emotional understanding, ask what people in the target population feel, what touches them, and what motivates them.
* To understand social interactions in groups, extend understanding beyond the individual.
* Do not rely on simply asking people to recount their activities, as this can result in skewed information.
* Use tools like video ethnography and computer interaction analysis to gather accurate data on group interactions.
* The designer must not be imagined as an anthropologist observing objectively; rather, invent new forms of collaboration that blur boundaries between creators and consumers ("us with them").
* Design challenges must be translated into practical design briefs that recognize constraints and establish metrics for success.
* Craft a brief with enough flexibility to release imagination and enough specificity to ground ideas in intended beneficiaries' lives.
* Design thinkers must ask "Why?" to reframe problems and redefine constraints.
* Do not accept a given constraint without asking if it's the right problem to be solving.
* Great design thinkers observe the ordinary.
* Make it a rule to stop and think about an ordinary situation at least once a day.

## **Deliverables & Communication**

* For an idea to become an experience, it must be implemented with the same care in which it is conceived.
* A successful experience requires active consumer participation.
* A compelling customer experience is likely delivered by employees operating within an experience culture.
* Every touchpoint must be executed with thoughtfulness and precision; experiences should be designed and engineered with attention to detail.
* It is forbidden to criticize coworkers for wearing casual clothing if they are wearing a Cool Biz badge (example from a case study used as a general principle of removing social barriers).
* Design with time: think about people as living, growing, thinking organisms who can help write their own stories.
* Storytelling must begin early in the life of a project and be woven into every aspect of the innovation effort.
* To make a new idea heard, it must tell a meaningful and compelling story.
* Advertising should help turn its audience into storytellers rather than just blasting messages.
* Anyone with a positive experience with an idea should be able to communicate its essential elements to encourage others to try it.
* Remember to document the design process as it unfolds (videos, drawings, sketches, presentation documents, physical prototypes).

## **System & Organizational Design**

* Every business idea must survive the test of the bottom line.
* Companies must yield some sovereign authority and engage in two-way conversations with customers to meet heightened expectations.
* Investment in systematic, design-based innovation that engages both employees and customers at the deepest level is important.
* The guiding principle for any system-wide project (large scale) is to ensure that the objectives of different participants are aligned.
* Instead of an inflexible, hierarchical process, create highly flexible, constantly evolving systems where each participant exchange is an opportunity for empathy, insight, innovation, and implementation.
* Empower individuals with some degree of control over the end result in large-scale systems.
* New kinds of participatory systems must deliver high-quality performance at least as good as top-down approaches.
* If open, flexible, large-scale systems are to realize their promise, their developers must open them up to the people who will use them.
* No compelling idea is of little value if it cannot be sustained by its intended customers.
* Systemic problems can only be addressed through system-wide collaboration.
* If we are to build on one another's good ideas, we must focus on a finite set of problems to allow for cumulative successes.
* Begin with nurturing the natural creativity of all children and keep it alive through education and professional life.
* Do not come up with the right answer to the wrong question.
* Record observations and ideas visually, even rough sketches or phone pictures. If you think you can’t draw, do it anyway.

## Key Highlights

* Design thinking must integrate what is desirable from a human point of view with what is technologically feasible and economically viable, always privileging the intended user as a starting point.
* For true innovation, do not approach new ideas by starting with prevailing business constraints; instead, demand and explore lots of options beyond the first promising solution.
* The goal of prototyping is to give form to an idea to learn about its strengths and weaknesses and to identify new directions, requiring designers to take prototypes out into the world for user feedback.
* To gain breakthrough insights, move beyond traditional focus groups and surveys by intensively observing ultimate clients where they live, work, and play to achieve empathy.
* Organizations must cultivate an ecosystem that provides room for experimentation and leaders who encourage it, accepting early failure as a source of learning.
* Senior leadership must actively tend, prune, and harvest ideas, demonstrating a serious commitment from the top to support and nurture bottom-up initiatives and design thinking talent.
* For complex problems, resist increasing the size of the core team early on; instead, channel energy productively by creating interdependent networks of small, focused teams.
* Transition from inflexible, hierarchical processes to highly flexible, constantly evolving systems that empower individuals and foster system-wide collaboration to address systemic problems effectively.
