**1. Overall Purpose**
Phase 1 aligns the UX/UI polish track with architecture and product goals, establishing experience benchmarks and design deliverables that will guide later refinements. Scope is limited to UX/UI research and planning.

**2. Core Execution Principles & Global Rules (MANDATORY)**
* Reference architecture compendium, frontend plan, and cross-track briefs.
* Apply standards `UX-STRAT`, `UI-GUIDE`, `ACC-STD`, `BRAND`, and `DOC-UX`.
* Collaborate with product/marketing teams for brand alignment.

**3. Mandatory Quality & Finalization Rules**
Store artifacts in `UX-UI_polish/outputs/phase-1/`, including experience principles, style inventory, accessibility baseline, and roadmap.

**4. Directive Section: UX/UI Polish Phase 1 Tasks**
* **Input Context:**
    * Architecture outputs, frontend blueprint, user research, brand guidelines.

* **Execution Tasks (sequential):**
    - [ ] **Task 1.1: Experience Audit** *(Analysis)*
        - [ ] Review requirements, personas, and user journeys; identify critical experience moments.
        - [ ] Document heuristics and usability risks.
    - [ ] **Task 1.2: Design System Alignment** *(Design)*
        - [ ] Inventory existing design tokens/components; map gaps relative to frontend plan.
        - [ ] Define typography, color, spacing, and motion guidelines referencing brand standards.
    - [ ] **Task 1.3: Accessibility Baseline** *(Accessibility)*
        - [ ] Establish accessibility goals (WCAG level, localization needs) and audit current assets.
        - [ ] Provide remediation checklist for frontend implementation.
    - [ ] **Task 1.4: Polish Roadmap** *(Planning)*
        - [ ] Build Phase -> Task -> Step plan for UX/UI enhancements (micro-interactions, responsive behavior, visual polish).
        - [ ] Identify dependencies on frontend/backend/security deliverables.
    - [ ] **Task 1.5: Communication Pack** *(Enablement)*
        - [ ] Create briefs for frontend/testing tracks outlining polish expectations and review cadence.
        - [ ] Store quality checklist as `ux_ui_quality_checklist.md`.

* **Internal Success Criteria:** Experience audit, design system alignment, accessibility baseline, roadmap, and briefs completed.
* **Internal Verification Method:** Ensure outputs align with architecture, cite standards, and reside in correct directory.

**5. Test Reporting Protocol (Internal)**
Log planning readiness and dependencies in `docs/Test_Result_Analysis.md` tagged `UX-PH1`.

**6. Final Instruction for this Phase**
Share UX/UI plan with frontend and product leadership before commencing detailed polish work.
