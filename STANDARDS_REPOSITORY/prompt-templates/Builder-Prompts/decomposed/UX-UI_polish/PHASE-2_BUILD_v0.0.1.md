**Subject: Phase 2: UX/UI Polish Track â€” Deliver Design Assets & Interaction Specifications for [Project Name]**

**Date:** [Enter Current Date]
**Time:** [Enter Current Time & UTC Offset]

**1. Overall Purpose**
Create high-fidelity design assets, interaction specs, and accessibility guidance that frontend engineers will implement. Scope includes design deliverables and documentation; no frontend code changes.

**2. Core Execution Principles & Global Rules (MANDATORY)**
* Follow experience principles, design system alignment, and accessibility baseline from Phase 1.
* Apply standards `UI-SPEC`, `UX-INTERACTION`, `ACC-GUIDE`, `DOC-UX`, and `BRAND`.
* Ensure assets are versioned and annotated for developers.

**3. Mandatory Quality & Finalization Rules**
Store outputs in `UX-UI_polish/outputs/phase-2/`, including Figma (or equivalent) exports, interaction specs, motion prototypes, and accessibility annotations.

**4. Directive Section: UX/UI Polish Phase 2 Tasks**
* **Input Context:**
    * Frontend build plan, architecture constraints, brand assets, user research insights.

* **Execution Tasks (sequential):**
    - [ ] **Task 2.1: Component Library Updates** *(Design)*
        - [ ] Design or refine UI components required for Phase 2 frontend implementation, including responsive states.
        - [ ] Document usage guidelines and variations.
    - [ ] **Task 2.2: Screen & Flow Design** *(Design)*
        - [ ] Produce high-fidelity screens/wireflows for prioritized user journeys.
        - [ ] Annotate layout, spacing, microcopy, and error states.
    - [ ] **Task 2.3: Interaction & Motion Specs** *(Interaction Design)*
        - [ ] Define motion parameters, transitions, and micro-interactions; provide prototypes or animation references.
        - [ ] Include accessibility considerations for motion sensitivity.
    - [ ] **Task 2.4: Accessibility Guidance** *(Accessibility)*
        - [ ] Provide color contrast validations, semantic structure recommendations, and assistive tech notes.
        - [ ] Update accessibility checklist for frontend testing.
    - [ ] **Task 2.5: Developer Handoff Package** *(Documentation)*
        - [ ] Compile `ux_ui_build_handoff.md` summarizing assets, acceptance criteria, and review cadence.
        - [ ] Organize files with naming conventions and versioning.

* **Internal Success Criteria:** All prioritized components/screens/specs delivered with annotations, accessibility guidance updated, handoff package ready.
* **Internal Verification Method:** Confirm assets align with architecture constraints, meet brand standards, and are accessible by frontend team.

**5. Test Reporting Protocol (Internal)**
Log design delivery status in `docs/Test_Result_Analysis.md` tagged `UX-PH2`.

**6. Final Instruction for this Phase**
Walk through assets with frontend team to ensure understanding before integration work.
