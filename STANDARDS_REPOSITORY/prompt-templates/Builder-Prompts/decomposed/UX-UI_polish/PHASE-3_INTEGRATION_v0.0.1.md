**Subject: Phase 3: UX/UI Polish Track â€” Review Implemented UI & Provide Iteration Guidance for [Project Name]**

**Date:** [Enter Current Date]
**Time:** [Enter Current Time & UTC Offset]

**1. Overall Purpose**
Evaluate frontend implementation against design specifications, accessibility standards, and experience goals. Provide feedback, defect reports, and updated assets as needed while staying within UX/UI scope.

**2. Core Execution Principles & Global Rules (MANDATORY)**
* Reference frontend integration builds, testing reports, and accessibility audits.
* Apply standards `UX-REVIEW`, `UI-QA`, `ACC-VERIFY`, and `DOC-UX`.
* All adjustments communicated via design updates or documented defects; no code changes.

**3. Mandatory Quality & Finalization Rules**
Store review artifacts in `UX-UI_polish/outputs/phase-3/`, including annotated screenshots, feedback logs, and updated design files.

**4. Directive Section: UX/UI Polish Phase 3 Tasks**
* **Input Context:**
    * Frontend integration environment, testing reports, analytics (if available).

* **Execution Tasks (sequential):**
    - [ ] **Task 3.1: Implementation Review** *(Evaluation)*
        - [ ] Compare implemented UI against design specs for layout, typography, color, and motion.
        - [ ] Capture discrepancies with annotated screenshots or videos.
    - [ ] **Task 3.2: Accessibility Verification** *(Accessibility)*
        - [ ] Conduct manual and automated accessibility checks, focusing on keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and contrast.
        - [ ] Document issues with severity and remediation guidance.
    - [ ] **Task 3.3: Experience QA Sessions** *(User Validation)*
        - [ ] Run usability walkthroughs or heuristic evaluations, noting friction points.
        - [ ] Recommend improvements to microcopy or interactions as needed.
    - [ ] **Task 3.4: Feedback Consolidation** *(Communication)*
        - [ ] Maintain `ux_ui_integration_feedback.md` summarizing findings, priorities, and owning teams.
        - [ ] Provide updated design assets if changes required.
    - [ ] **Task 3.5: Alignment Meeting** *(Coordination)*
        - [ ] Review findings with frontend/testing teams, ensuring acceptance and timelines for fixes.

* **Internal Success Criteria:** Review completed, issues prioritized, updated assets delivered, alignment achieved with frontend/testing.
* **Internal Verification Method:** Verify feedback log covers all target screens, ensure assets updated and accessible, confirm no direct code modifications.

**5. Test Reporting Protocol (Internal)**
Log review outcomes in `docs/Test_Result_Analysis.md` tagged `UX-PH3`.

**6. Final Instruction for this Phase**
Monitor remediation progress and prepare for validation sign-off once fixes applied.
