**Subject: Phase 2: Security Focus - Build Architectural Component: [Component Name] (STRICT SCOPE)**

**Date:** [Customizer: Fill with Current Date]
**Time:** [Customizer: Fill with Current Time and Offset]

**1. Overall Purpose**
This prompt initiates **Phase 2: Component Build** for the architectural component identified below: **[Component Name]**. This is part of the larger **[Project Name]** project. The objectives for the agent executing this prompt are:
    a. **Contextualize:** Retrieve and internalize the detailed specifications for **[Component Name]** from the finalized Phase 1 Architectural Blueprint.
    b. **Plan:** Generate a detailed, standards-compliant execution plan (Phase -> Task -> Step) based *only* on the retrieved specifications and the Apex Standards Guide, covering implementation, component-level testing, and documentation **strictly for [Component Name]**.
    c. **Execute:** Rigorously execute the generated plan to produce verified, tested, and documented output **exclusively for this component, [Component Name]**, integrating it correctly with the existing project state as defined by its dependencies ONLY. **Work MUST NOT extend beyond this component's defined scope.**

**2. Core Execution Principles & Global Rules (MANDATORY ADHERENCE - REITERATED)**
*(Customizer Note: This section is invariant; include verbatim in the final prompt)*
Adherence to these principles, established in Phase 1, remains **ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY** and non-negotiable for this component build:

* **Apex Standards Adherence:** Compliance with the **Apex Software Compliance Standards Guide** (located at `[User Input: Path to Standards Guide]`) is paramount. All generated plans, code, tests, and documentation for **[Component Name]** MUST comply. Follow all referenced `[(Rule #X: CODE)](...)` links precisely.
* **Strict Sequential Execution (Within Component Plan):** Execute the generated component plan (`Phase -> Task -> Step`, `- [ ]`) strictly sequentially. Completion requires meeting `Internal Success Criteria` via `Internal Verification Method` before marking `- [x]` and proceeding.
* **Internal Verification & Standards Compliance Check:** Rigorous internal verification, explicitly including checks against all referenced `(Rule #X: CODE)` links, is required before marking any plan item complete.
* **Recursive Error Handling / Retry Logic:** Failures require immediate halt, root cause analysis, correction, and re-verification until success.
* **Autonomous Operation & Internal Logging:** Operate autonomously on the plan execution. Log results internally per the `Test Reporting Protocol` (Section 5).

**3. Mandatory Quality & Finalization Rules (Reference Standards Guide - Continuous Enforcement)**
*(Customizer Note: This section is invariant; include verbatim. Ensure path is correct.)*
Continuously enforce **all** applicable rules from the **Apex Software Compliance Standards Guide** (`[User Input: Path to Standards Guide]`) during the build of **[Component Name]**. This includes, but is not limited to:
* Code Quality & Structure (Section 8: `QUAL-*`, incl. `QUAL-SIZE`)
* Configuration Management (Section 12: `CONF-*`)
* Security (Section 13: `SEC-*`)
* Testing & Verification (Section 14: `TEST-*` - Focus on component-level tests)
* Documentation (Section 18: `DOC-*`)
* Implementation Correctness (Section 19: `IMPL-*`)
* *(Customizer: Add any specific standard sections relevant to component implementation based on Phase 1 output or user override, if applicable)*

**4. Directive Section: Phase 2 - Component Planning and Execution (Single Component Focus)**

* **Context Provided by User (for Customizer):**
    * `[User Input: Project Name]:` The overall project name.
    * `[User Input: Component Name]:` The specific component to build in this iteration. **THIS IS THE ONLY COMPONENT TO BE WORKED ON.**
    * `[User Input: Path to Phase 1 Output]:` The location of the finalized Phase 1 Architectural Blueprint document.
    * `[User Input: Path to Standards Guide]:` The location of the Apex Standards Guide.
    * `[User Input: Current Project State Reference]:` How the worker LLM accesses the current project state (e.g., "Current Git working directory", "Shared filesystem path: /path/to/project").

* **Instructions for Worker LLM (Generated by Customizer):**

    **CRITICAL SCOPE LIMITATION:** All actions performed in response to this prompt MUST be strictly confined to the planning and implementation of the **single designated component: [Component Name]**. Do NOT modify unrelated code, revisit Phase 1 architectural decisions, implement features beyond this component's retrieved specification, or perform work outside this component's defined scope and documented dependencies.

    1.  **Load Context (for [Component Name] ONLY):**
        * Identify the *sole* component to build: **[Component Name]**.
        * Locate and parse the Phase 1 Architectural Blueprint at `[Path to Phase 1 Output]`.
        * Extract *only* the specifications defined for **[Component Name]**: its requirements, relevant NFR impacts, dependencies, technology stack details, and architectural role/responsibilities.
        * Confirm successful extraction or report failure immediately if details are missing/ambiguous for **[Component Name]**.
        * Ensure awareness of the **Apex Standards Guide** at `[Path to Standards Guide]`.
        * Acknowledge the current project state accessible via `[Current Project State Reference]`.

    2.  **Generate Detailed Component Execution Plan (for [Component Name] ONLY):**
        * Based *exclusively* on the extracted specifications for **[Component Name]** and the mandatory **Apex Standards Guide**, generate a detailed execution plan **solely for [Component Name]**.
        * The plan MUST use the hierarchical `Phase -> Task -> Step` format (each item starting with `- [ ]`).
        * The plan MUST comprehensively cover (within the scope of **[Component Name]**):
            * Implementation of specified functionality.
            * Creation and execution of **component-level tests** (e.g., unit tests) [(Rule #? : TEST-UNIT)](...).
            * Generation of required code documentation [(Rule #? : DOC-CODE)](...).
            * Implementation of integration points *only as defined by dependencies* in the blueprint.
            * Explicit `[(Rule #N: CODE)](...)` links to *all* applicable standards.
            * Clear `Internal Success Criteria` and `Internal Verification Methods` for each Task.
            * *(Conditional): Include standard setup script task ONLY if **[Component Name]** is the very first component requiring it, as defined in Phase 1.*

    3.  **Execute Generated Plan (for [Component Name] ONLY):**
        * Rigorously execute the plan generated in the previous step, **confining all code generation, modification, testing, and documentation efforts strictly to the [Component Name] component's defined scope and necessary integration points with its direct dependencies.**
        * Follow strict sequential order (`- [ ]` -> `- [x]`).
        * Perform all `Internal Verification Methods`.
        * Run all component tests for **[Component Name]** and ensure they pass.
        * Generate/modify code and documentation for **[Component Name]**, ensuring 100% compliance with standards.
        * Log execution progress for **[Component Name]** to the internal log (`docs/Test_Result_Analysis.md`) per the Reporting Protocol (Section 5).

* **Internal Success Criteria Check (Worker LLM Self-Check):** Before reporting completion, verify: Was context for **[Component Name]** ONLY loaded? Was a detailed, compliant plan generated **strictly for [Component Name]**? Was the plan fully executed with successful verification/tests **within the scope of [Component Name]**? Is the resulting code/docs for **[Component Name]** compliant? Were logs updated? **Was work confined ONLY to [Component Name]?**
* **Internal Verification Method (Worker LLM Self-Check):** Review own execution trace. Check final code against standards. Confirm log entries. **Verify that generated/modified files belong only to the [Component Name] component or its explicitly defined interface/integration points.**

**5. Test Reporting Protocol (Internal)**
*(Customizer Note: This section is invariant; include verbatim.)*
* **Log File Location:** `docs/Test_Result_Analysis.md` (relative to project root)
* **Data Points per Entry:** Date/Time, Scope (Component: **[Component Name]**, Task/Step ID, Test Suite), Pass/Fail Status, Key Metrics, Summary Findings/Errors.
* **Update Frequency:** After relevant Task/Phase/Component testing activities and verification steps during execution.

**6. Final Instruction (for Worker LLM)**
Execute the context loading, detailed planning, and rigorous execution steps outlined in Section 4, focusing **EXCLUSIVELY** on the single component: **[Component Name]**. Upon successful completion of all steps and internal checks:
    * Report overall success for the build of **[Component Name]**.
    * Confirm all **[Component Name]** tests passed and logs are updated.
    * Provide clear references (e.g., file paths, git commit hash) to the newly created or modified code and documentation files **belonging solely to [Component Name]**.
    * Provide the finalized component execution plan for **[Component Name]** (with all items marked `- [x]`).
