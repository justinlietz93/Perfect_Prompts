**Subject: Phase 5: Testing Track â€” Release Support & Post-Launch Monitoring Setup for [Project Name]**

**Date:** [Enter Current Date]
**Time:** [Enter Current Time & UTC Offset]

**1. Overall Purpose**
Support production release by finalizing testing handoff materials, configuring post-launch monitoring, and defining regression plans. Testing team ensures ongoing quality oversight after go-live.

**2. Core Execution Principles & Global Rules (MANDATORY)**
* Follow `REL-TEST`, `OPS-TEST`, `DOC-HANDOFF`, and `POST-RELEASE` standards.
* Use validation report, release plan, and governance playbook as guidance.
* Provide clear instructions for operations and product teams on test execution during release.

**3. Mandatory Quality & Finalization Rules**
Store outputs in `testing/outputs/phase-5/`, including release test playbook, monitoring dashboards, regression schedule, and retrospective plan.

**4. Directive Section: Testing Phase 5 Tasks**
* **Input Context:**
    * Testing validation report, release schedule, operations contact list.

* **Execution Tasks (sequential):**
    - [ ] **Task 5.1: Release Test Playbook** *(Enablement)*
        - [ ] Document smoke tests, sanity checks, and rollback verification steps for release windows.
        - [ ] Provide execution responsibilities and timing.
    - [ ] **Task 5.2: Monitoring & Alert Configuration** *(Operations)*
        - [ ] Set up dashboards tracking key quality metrics (errors, latency, UX signals).
        - [ ] Configure alert thresholds and routing for test failures in production monitoring.
    - [ ] **Task 5.3: Regression Planning** *(Planning)*
        - [ ] Define post-release regression schedule and ownership.
        - [ ] Identify areas requiring increased test automation post-launch.
    - [ ] **Task 5.4: Knowledge Transfer** *(Communication)*
        - [ ] Conduct handoff with operations/product teams, capturing questions and outstanding actions.
        - [ ] Update `testing_runbook.md` with release support procedures.
    - [ ] **Task 5.5: Retrospective Preparation** *(Improvement)*
        - [ ] Schedule post-launch testing retrospective and outline metrics to review.
        - [ ] Collect lessons learned to feed into future projects.

* **Internal Success Criteria:** Release playbook published, monitoring configured, regression plan defined, handoff completed.
* **Internal Verification Method:** Ensure deliverables stored, stakeholders acknowledge responsibilities, monitoring dashboards live.

**5. Test Reporting Protocol (Internal)**
Log release readiness confirmation in `docs/Test_Result_Analysis.md` tagged `TEST-PH5`.

**6. Final Instruction for this Phase**
Support go-live execution and monitor initial release window, ready to trigger regression or rollback procedures as needed.
