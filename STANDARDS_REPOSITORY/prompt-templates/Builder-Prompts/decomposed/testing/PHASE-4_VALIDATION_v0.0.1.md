**Subject: Phase 4: Testing Track â€” Validation Evidence & Release Gate Assessment for [Project Name]**

**Date:** [Enter Current Date]
**Time:** [Enter Current Time & UTC Offset]

**1. Overall Purpose**
Finalize validation activities across functional, non-functional, and compliance areas to certify release readiness. Testing team aggregates evidence and assesses go/no-go status.

**2. Core Execution Principles & Global Rules (MANDATORY)**
* Apply standards `TEST-VAL`, `PERF-TEST`, `SEC-TEST`, `UX-TEST`, and `DOC-VAL`.
* Use release-candidate builds and final environments.
* Ensure traceability to requirements and risk mitigations.

**3. Mandatory Quality & Finalization Rules**
Store outputs in `testing/outputs/phase-4/`, including validation summary, evidence index, and residual defect list with severities.

**4. Directive Section: Testing Phase 4 Tasks**
* **Input Context:**
    * Integration reports, validation plans from other tracks, architecture certification checklist.

* **Execution Tasks (sequential):**
    - [ ] **Task 4.1: Validation Scope Confirmation** *(Planning)*
        - [ ] Ensure all planned test suites executed or explicitly waived.
        - [ ] Update traceability matrix with final coverage status.
    - [ ] **Task 4.2: Non-Functional Test Execution** *(Testing)*
        - [ ] Run performance, resilience, accessibility, and security regression tests per plan.
        - [ ] Capture metrics, compare to thresholds, and document deviations.
    - [ ] **Task 4.3: Defect & Risk Assessment** *(Quality)*
        - [ ] Consolidate remaining defects, categorize severity, and align on remediation/waiver decisions.
        - [ ] Update risk register with validation outcomes.
    - [ ] **Task 4.4: Evidence Compilation** *(Documentation)*
        - [ ] Assemble `testing_validation_report.md` summarizing executed tests, results, and outstanding risks.
        - [ ] Provide evidence index linking to logs, metrics, and supporting documents.
    - [ ] **Task 4.5: Go/No-Go Recommendation** *(Governance)*
        - [ ] Prepare recommendation for release readiness board with clear criteria and supporting data.

* **Internal Success Criteria:** Validation plan completed, evidence compiled, recommendation prepared, stakeholders informed.
* **Internal Verification Method:** Review traceability matrix, ensure all requirements have evidence or waivers; confirm documentation stored.

**5. Test Reporting Protocol (Internal)**
Log validation outcomes in `docs/Test_Result_Analysis.md` tagged `TEST-PH4`.

**6. Final Instruction for this Phase**
Present validation report to release governance body and support decision making.
