**Subject: Phase 5: Backend Track â€” Release Preparation & Operations Handoff for [Project Name]**

**Date:** [Enter Current Date]
**Time:** [Enter Current Time & UTC Offset]

**1. Overall Purpose**
Finalize backend artifacts for production release, ensuring deployment pipelines, runbooks, and support processes are ready. Work is confined to backend assets and collaboration with operations/security.

**2. Core Execution Principles & Global Rules (MANDATORY)**
* Follow `REL-BACKEND`, `DOC-RUNBOOK`, `OPS-API`, `SEC-OPS`, and `DATA-OPS` standards.
* Use validation outputs and architecture governance playbook as guidance.
* Produce reproducible deployment artifacts (containers, migrations, configuration).

**3. Mandatory Quality & Finalization Rules**
Store outputs in `backend/outputs/phase-5/`. Include release notes, rollback strategies, database migration plans, and on-call rotation details.

**4. Directive Section: Backend Phase 5 Tasks**
* **Input Context:**
    * Backend validation report, architecture governance playbook, release plan.
    * Operations requirements (monitoring, alerting, scaling policies).

* **Execution Tasks (sequential):**
    - [ ] **Task 5.1: Deployment Artifact Finalization** *(Build)*
        - [ ] Package backend services (container images or binaries) with version tags and checksums.
        - [ ] Bundle migrations and seed scripts with rollback steps documented.
    - [ ] **Task 5.2: Pipeline & Configuration Review** *(Automation)*
        - [ ] Validate CI/CD pipeline stages, ensuring tests and security scans enforced.
        - [ ] Document environment-specific configuration requirements.
    - [ ] **Task 5.3: Operational Runbooks** *(Enablement)*
        - [ ] Produce runbooks covering startup, shutdown, scaling, and incident response.
        - [ ] Define monitoring dashboards, alert thresholds, and log aggregation expectations.
    - [ ] **Task 5.4: Handoff & Training** *(Communication)*
        - [ ] Conduct knowledge transfer with operations/security, capturing minutes and action items.
        - [ ] Share release notes summarizing backend changes, APIs, and known limitations.
    - [ ] **Task 5.5: Final Approvals & Archiving** *(Governance)*
        - [ ] Collect sign-offs from architecture, security, and operations leads.
        - [ ] Archive deployment artifacts and documentation with version metadata.

* **Internal Success Criteria:** Deployment artifacts verified, pipelines reviewed, runbooks delivered, approvals obtained.
* **Internal Verification Method:** Cross-check release deliverables against governance checklist and confirm storage locations.

**5. Test Reporting Protocol (Internal)**
Log release readiness and smoke test confirmations in `docs/Test_Result_Analysis.md` tagged `BACK-PH5`.

**6. Final Instruction for this Phase**
Hand off backend release package to operations and support go/no-go decision making.
