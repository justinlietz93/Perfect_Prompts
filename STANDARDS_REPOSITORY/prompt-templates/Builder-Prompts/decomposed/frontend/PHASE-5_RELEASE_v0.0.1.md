**Date:** [Enter Current Date]
**Time:** [Enter Current Time & UTC Offset]

**1. Overall Purpose**
Phase 5 finalizes the frontend deliverable for production release, ensuring deployment artifacts, documentation, and support materials are complete. The worker agent focuses on presentation layer readiness and does not modify backend infrastructure.

**2. Core Execution Principles & Global Rules (MANDATORY)**
* Follow `REL-UI`, `DOC-HANDOFF`, `OPS-UI`, and `SEC-OPS` standards.
* Release artifacts must align with the architecture governance playbook and operational requirements.
* Deliverables include build outputs, deployment configuration references, and knowledge transfer resources.

**3. Mandatory Quality & Finalization Rules**
Store outputs in `frontend/outputs/phase-5/`. Ensure reproducible builds, versioned artifacts, and documented release notes. Record support contacts and on-call expectations.

**4. Directive Section: Frontend Phase 5 Tasks**
* **Input Context:**
    * Validation report, architecture governance playbook, release plan.
    * Operations requirements for hosting, monitoring, and alerts.

* **Execution Tasks (sequential):**
    - [ ] **Task 5.1: Release Build Preparation** *(Build)*
        - [ ] Generate production build using approved configuration.
        - [ ] Capture build metadata (commit hash, tool versions, bundle sizes).
    - [ ] **Task 5.2: Deployment Package Assembly** *(Packaging)*
        - [ ] Prepare deployable artifact (e.g., static assets archive, container image instructions) with checksum manifest.
        - [ ] Document environment variables and CDN/cache settings required.
    - [ ] **Task 5.3: Operational Readiness** *(Enablement)*
        - [ ] Provide runbook entries covering smoke tests, rollback strategy, and monitoring dashboards relevant to the frontend.
        - [ ] List SLOs/SLIs tracked for the presentation layer.
    - [ ] **Task 5.4: Communication & Training** *(Handoff)*
        - [ ] Conduct knowledge transfer with support teams, capturing questions/answers in `frontend_handoff_minutes.md`.
        - [ ] Publish release notes focusing on user-facing changes, known issues, and mitigation steps.
    - [ ] **Task 5.5: Final Sign-off** *(Governance)*
        - [ ] Obtain approvals from architecture, UX, testing, and operations stakeholders.
        - [ ] Archive artifacts and update `frontend/CHANGELOG.md` with release entry.

* **Internal Success Criteria:** Production build reproducible, deployment instructions complete, support teams briefed, sign-offs recorded.
* **Internal Verification Method:** Cross-check release package against governance checklist and ensure all deliverables stored.

**5. Test Reporting Protocol (Internal)**
Log release smoke test results and approvals in `docs/Test_Result_Analysis.md` tagged `FRONT-PH5`.

**6. Final Instruction for this Phase**
Deliver final release package to operations and confirm readiness for go-live window.
