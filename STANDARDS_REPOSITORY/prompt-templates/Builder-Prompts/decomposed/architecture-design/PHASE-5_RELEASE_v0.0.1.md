**Subject: Phase 5: Architecture Track â€” Release Governance & Operational Handoff for [Project Name]**

**Date:** [Enter Current Date]
**Time:** [Enter Current Time & UTC Offset]

**1. Overall Purpose**
Final phase ensures architecture deliverables are ready for production release and ongoing operations. The worker agent must formalize governance artifacts, support release planning, and hand off stewardship to operations and product leadership.

**2. Core Execution Principles & Global Rules (MANDATORY)**
* Leverage validated architecture artifacts only; do not introduce new structural changes unless critical defects arise.
* Follow `ARCH-OPS`, `DOC-HANDOFF`, `SEC-OPS`, and `PLAN-RELEASE` standards.
* All hand-off packages must be self-contained and accessible to operations teams.

**3. Mandatory Quality & Finalization Rules**
Archive finalized artifacts with immutable tags, ensure retention policies, and document operational contacts. Release governance requires sign-off from architecture, security, and operations leads.

**4. Directive Section: Architecture Phase 5 Tasks**
* **Input Context:**
    * Certified validation packet from Phase 4.
    * Release plan drafts from project management.
    * Standards guide `[relative_path_to_standards]`.

* **Execution Tasks (sequential):**
    - [ ] **Task 5.1: Governance Finalization** *(Governance)*
        - [ ] Produce `architecture_governance_playbook.md` outlining change control, escalation paths, and KPIs.
        - [ ] Define architectural health metrics for ongoing monitoring.
    - [ ] **Task 5.2: Operational Readiness Support** *(Enablement)*
        - [ ] Collaborate with operations to map architecture components to deployment topology and monitoring tooling.
        - [ ] Provide runbooks or references ensuring architecture assumptions are upheld.
    - [ ] **Task 5.3: Release Advisory** *(Planning)*
        - [ ] Review release plan, confirm sequencing aligns with dependency graph, and note critical checkpoints.
        - [ ] Document rollback triggers tied to architectural risk thresholds.
    - [ ] **Task 5.4: Knowledge Transfer** *(Communication)*
        - [ ] Conduct architecture hand-off session, capturing Q&A and decisions in `handoff_minutes.md`.
        - [ ] Publish contact list and maintenance responsibilities.
    - [ ] **Task 5.5: Archive & Closeout** *(Closeout)*
        - [ ] Archive all architecture artifacts with version tags and checksum manifests.
        - [ ] Update risk register to reflect post-release monitoring items.

* **Internal Success Criteria:** Governance playbook completed, operational readiness confirmed, hand-off documented, archives sealed.
* **Internal Verification Method:** Review with operations lead to confirm understanding and acceptance; verify archives and change control processes accessible.

**5. Test Reporting Protocol (Internal)**
Log release readiness approvals and outstanding watch items in `docs/Test_Result_Analysis.md` tagged `ARCH-PH5`.

**6. Final Instruction for this Phase**
Formally sign off on architecture track completion and transfer ongoing ownership to operations/governance teams.
