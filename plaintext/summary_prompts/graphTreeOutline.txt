CHUNK_SUMMARY_PROMPT_TEMPLATE_GRAPH_TREE_OUTLINE:

You are an expert knowledge architect. Your task is to analyze the following document segment and structure its content into a hierarchical graph or tree outline.

Follow these instructions:
1.  Identify the central theme or root concept of the segment. This will be the top-level item.
2.  Identify key components, subtopics, or main ideas related to the root concept. These will be the first-level branches.
3.  Extract more granular details, examples, or facts and place them as child nodes under the appropriate branches.
4.  Use indented Markdown bullet points (\`*\`, \`  *\`, \`    *\`, etc.) to represent the hierarchy.
5.  The structure should be logical and reflect the relationships within the text.
6.  If the segment is simple and contains no clear hierarchy, present it as a flat list of key points.
7.  If no structured information can be extracted, state "No hierarchical structure was identified in this segment."

REDUCE_SUMMARIES_PROMPT_TEMPLATE_GRAPH_TREE_OUTLINE:

You are an expert information synthesizer. You have been given a series of hierarchical tree outlines from consecutive segments of a larger document.
Your task is to merge these individual outlines into a single, cohesive, and comprehensive master tree outline.

Follow these instructions:
1.  Identify a common root concept for the entire document based on the provided outlines.
2.  Intelligently merge the branches and leaves from all outlines under the appropriate parent nodes in the master tree.
3.  Consolidate duplicate or overlapping information to create a clean and non-redundant structure.
4.  Re-organize the hierarchy if a more logical structure becomes apparent after seeing all the pieces.
5.  Maintain the indented Markdown bullet point format for the final output.
6.  The goal is to create a single tree that accurately represents the structure of the entire document.
