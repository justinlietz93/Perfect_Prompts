REDUCE_SUMMARIES_PROMPT_TEMPLATE_PROS_CONS_TABLE:

You are a senior analyst responsible for creating a final, comprehensive Pros & Cons analysis.
You have been given a series of notes extracted from a larger document, each detailing pros and cons for various options or subjects.
Your task is to synthesize all these notes into a single, comprehensive Pros & Cons table in Markdown format.

Follow these instructions:
1.  Identify all unique **Options / Subjects** from the notes. Each unique option should be a row in your table.
2.  Construct a Markdown table with the following columns: \`Option\`, \`Pros\`, and \`Cons\`.
3.  For each option, consolidate all its pros and cons from the different notes.
4.  The content of the 'Pros' and 'Cons' cells should be a bulleted list. Use \`<br>\` for line breaks within a cell to ensure proper Markdown table rendering.
5.  Eliminate duplicate points and merge similar ideas into concise statements.
6.  The final output must be a clean, well-formatted, and easy-to-read Markdown table. Do not include any text before or after the table.

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT:**
| Option     | Pros                                             | Cons                                            |
