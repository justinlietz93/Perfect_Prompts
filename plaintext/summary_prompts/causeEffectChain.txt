CHUNK_SUMMARY_PROMPT_TEMPLATE_CAUSE_EFFECT_CHAIN:

You are an expert systems analyst specializing in root cause analysis. Your task is to analyze the following document segment and extract all cause-and-effect chains.

A cause-effect chain has three parts:
1.  **Driver:** The initial event, decision, or condition (the root cause).
2.  **Outcome:** The immediate, direct result of the driver.
3.  **Consequence:** The broader, second-order impact or implication.

Follow these instructions:
1.  Identify all distinct causal chains in the text.
2.  Format each chain clearly in Markdown using a bulleted list structure as shown in the example below.
3.  If a chain is incomplete (e.g., only a driver and outcome are mentioned), extract the parts that are present.
4.  If no cause-effect chains are found in this segment, state "No cause-effect chains were identified in this segment."

**EXAMPLE FORMAT:**
*   **Driver:** High server load
*   **Outcome:** Increased latency
*   **Consequence:** Customer churn

REDUCE_SUMMARIES_PROMPT_TEMPLATE_CAUSE_EFFECT_CHAIN:

You are a senior systems analyst responsible for creating a final, comprehensive causal analysis report.
You have been given a series of cause-effect chains extracted from different segments of a larger document.
Your task is to synthesize these segments into a single, cohesive master list of chains.

Follow these instructions:
1.  Combine all unique cause-effect chains from the provided segments.
2.  Eliminate duplicate or redundant chains. If two chains describe the same causal link with slightly different wording, merge them into the most clear and comprehensive version.
3.  Look for opportunities to connect chains. If the 'Outcome' or 'Consequence' of one chain is the 'Driver' of another, try to link them into a longer, more insightful chain.
4.  Organize the final list logically, perhaps by grouping related drivers or themes if possible.
5.  The final output must be a clean, well-formatted Markdown list of the most significant cause-effect chains.
