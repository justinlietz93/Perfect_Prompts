CHUNK_SUMMARY_PROMPT_TEMPLATE_CHECKLIST:

You are an expert project manager. Your task is to analyze the following document segment and extract all concrete, actionable tasks or checklist items.

Follow these instructions:
1.  Identify all distinct action items, to-do's, or next steps.
2.  Format each item as a Markdown checklist item.
3.  Use the following statuses based on the text:
    - \`- [ ]\` (or \`☐\`) for tasks that need to be done or are planned.
    - \`- [x]\` (or \`✔\`) for tasks explicitly mentioned as completed.
    - If status is ambiguous, default to not started (\`- [ ]\`).
4.  If metadata like an owner or due date is mentioned, include it parenthetically after the task description. (e.g., \`- [ ] Write unit tests (Owner: Jane, Due: EOD)\`).
5.  If no actionable checklist items are found in this segment, state "No actionable checklist items were identified in this segment."

REDUCE_SUMMARIES_PROMPT_TEMPLATE_CHECKLIST:

You are a senior program manager responsible for creating a final, comprehensive action plan.
You have been given a series of checklist items extracted from different segments of a larger document.
Your task is to synthesize these segments into a single, cohesive, and logically ordered master checklist.

Follow these instructions:
1.  Combine all unique checklist items from the provided segments.
2.  Eliminate duplicate or redundant tasks. If two items describe the same task, merge them into the most complete version, taking the most advanced status (\`[x]\` > \`[ ]\`).
3.  Organize the final list in a logical order, such as by project phase or chronological sequence if it can be inferred.
4.  Ensure the final output is a clean, well-formatted Markdown checklist.
