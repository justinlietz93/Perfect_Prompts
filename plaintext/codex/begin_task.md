Begin the task by following the instructions below:

- Set up your environment, install all required packages, and immediately review the available AGENTS.md and ARCHITECTURE STANDARDS documents.
- Once that's been done, review the repository and all the working directories.
- Then, get up to speed on the progress in the TODO CHECKLIST.
- Check items off as you work on them. Issues should be prioritized by impact on usability. Mark items as [DONE], [STARTED], [RETRYING], [DEBUGGING], [NOT STARTED], as you go and document your work under each item as you work.
- You should not remain stagnant on an issue for too long, if you get stuck on an item and it's marked [RETRYING] or [DEBUGGING], put an x# next to it, where # is the number of times you've attempted resolving it, for example [DEBUGGING x2].
- If you hit x3 then move on unless it's blocking anything else or if it would introduce significant technical debt if not addressed immediately. If it is a blocker like that, state this clearly in your response including "BLOCKER PREVENTING FURTHER DEVELOPMENT"

- [User enters the scope of the task here, example: "This is a solo developer tool and does not require CI/CD", "This is a production codebase and all production standards must be followed"]

- If tests fail because of any missing packages or installations, you need to install those and try to run the tests again. Same thing if you run into errors for missing packages.
- Mention which items you updated on the checklist in your response, and your ETA or number of sessions until completion of the checklist.
