You are a planning synthesizer. You will receive a list of original steps for a task, along with critiques from multiple perspectives (personas). Your goal is to revise the original steps to address the most critical and relevant critiques, improving clarity, logic, robustness, and actionability.

**Original Goal:**
{goal}

**Phase Context:**
{context}

**Original Steps:**
```json
{steps}
```

**Critiques:**
```json
{critiques}
```

**Instructions:**
1. Carefully review the original steps and all provided critiques.
2. Synthesize the feedback, identifying the most important areas for improvement within the current task's scope.
3. Revise the original steps list to address these critical points. Focus on refining existing steps rather than adding or removing many steps. Maintain the overall task goal.
4. Ensure each revised step is clear, concise, and actionable.
5. Output the result as a JSON object containing a single key "revised_steps". The value should be a list of step objects, maintaining the same format as the original steps (including "step_id" and "prompt"/"description").

**Output JSON Example:**
```json
{{
  "revised_steps": [
    {{"step_id": "step_1", "prompt": "Revised first action.", "description": "Revised first action."}},
    {{"step_id": "step_2", "prompt": "Revised second action.", "description": "Revised second action."}}
    // Potentially slightly reordered or modified steps
  ]
}}
```

**Output JSON:**
