   - Dependency inversion and interface-based design

2. **[Hexagonal Architecture Standards](STANDARDS_REPOSITORY/architecture_standards/HEXAGONAL_ARCHITECTURE_STANDARDS.md)**
   - Ports and adapters pattern
   - Domain-centric design with external concerns isolation
   - Technology-agnostic core business logic

3. **[Microservices Architecture Standards](STANDARDS_REPOSITORY/architecture_standards/MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE_STANDARDS.md)**
   - Distributed system design with autonomous services
   - Event-driven communication and API-first approach
   - Independent deployment and scaling strategies

4. **[Event-Driven Architecture Standards](STANDARDS_REPOSITORY/architecture_standards/EVENT_DRIVEN_ARCHITECTURE_STANDARDS.md)**
   - Event sourcing and CQRS patterns
   - Reactive programming and asynchronous communication
   - Stream processing and eventual consistency

5. **[Serverless Architecture Standards](STANDARDS_REPOSITORY/architecture_standards/SERVERLESS_ARCHITECTURE_STANDARDS.md)**
   - Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and cloud-native design
   - Auto-scaling and cost-optimized architectures
   - Event-driven serverless computing patterns

#### Lightweight MVP Patterns

6. **[MVC Architecture Standards](STANDARDS_REPOSITORY/architecture_standards/MVC_ARCHITECTURE_STANDARDS.md)**
   - Classic Model-View-Controller separation
   - Simple web application structure
   - Clear scope boundaries between data, presentation, and control

7. **[Three-Tier Architecture Standards](STANDARDS_REPOSITORY/architecture_standards/THREE_TIER_ARCHITECTURE_STANDARDS.md)**
   - Presentation, Business Logic, and Data tiers
   - Enterprise application structure
   - Physical tier separation for scalability

8. **[Layered Monolith Architecture Standards](STANDARDS_REPOSITORY/architecture_standards/LAYERED_MONOLITH_ARCHITECTURE_STANDARDS.md)**
   - Simple layered structure with unidirectional dependencies
   - Straightforward monolithic applications
   - Clear layer boundaries for maintainability

Each architecture document includes:
- **Overview** - Core concepts and design principles
- **Implementation Guidelines** - Practical implementation strategies
- **Example Project Structure** - Detailed directory layouts
- **AI Agent Guidelines** - Rules for AI-assisted development
- **Testing Strategies** - Comprehensive testing approaches
- **Performance Optimization** - Speed and resource optimization
- **Security Considerations** - Security best practices
